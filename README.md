1.Search for an html element via ID | CLASS | ALL
2.Select elements for debugging
3.Select css properties for debugging


Needs work:

utils.js    ->  getName needs to be reworked for less 
            collison for elements with no identifiers( plain html tags )

Expand.js   ->  allow for user selective css properties
            ->  toggle ui for DOM elements when being selected /unselected
            ->  display currently tracked DOM elements

Overall     ->  update the css and ui
            ->  seperate from a react app into an npm module
            ->  create and host a demo app with the module it

Future
            -> edit CSS properties on the browswer with live reloading (research?)
